# To-do List

- M3x5 screw too small, M3x10 too large
- Add a photograph showing all of the necessary equipment.
- Add a photograph showing the switches on the back of the Olimex card and another showing welding spots Olimex card: add a female connector on the GPIO3 for wire layout

# Suggestion(s) for improvement

- Add a 5V fan to cool the KoomBook when it is plugged in a main power supply. Or use an underpowered 12V (KoomBook has 5V supply) to operate at reduced speed. Longer life span, less noise. Fan can be used exclusively with cooling circuit so that air does not go through components.
