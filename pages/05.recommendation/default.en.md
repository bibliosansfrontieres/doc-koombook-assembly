# Before you start:

* Discharge yourself of all static electricity before handling the motherboard. The cardâ€™s electronic components are very sensitive to static electricity and can be permanently damaged. It can be done by touching an matalic case or the Earth pin of a power outlet
* Handle the micro USB baseplate with great care. The metal brackets are very fragile.
