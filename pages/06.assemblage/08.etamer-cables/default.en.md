2. Place a bit of tin on the tip of the soldering iron. Heat the stripped end of the wire with the iron. Place a bit of tin on the end while it is still hot so the tin completely covers the wire.

/!\ **IMPORTANT**: Do not heat the tin for too long. It may burn. Use as little tin as possible and complete this step in a well-aired room.

3. Repeat this step for both ends of all 3 wires.
