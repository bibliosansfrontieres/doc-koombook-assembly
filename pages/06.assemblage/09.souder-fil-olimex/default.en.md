# Weld 1 wire onto the Olimex card

## Equipment needed

* A20 Olimex card
* 15 cm of red wire which has been tinned at both ends
* Soldering iron
* Tin

## Assembly

1. Locate the GPIO 3 \(see the yellow circle in the photo\). 
   Then locate prong \# 33, circled in red. You can also count four prongs up from the bottom left-hand side of the GPIO 3.

   /!\ **IMPORTANT**: Do not heat the prongs for too long during welding. Make sure the tin does not touch the adjacent prongs.
